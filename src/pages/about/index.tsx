              <h2>Hobbies üë®‚ÄçüíªüéÆ</h2>
              Since Childhood I've always been attentive and connected with
              computer and technology, mostly playing, but just by fact it's on
              the pc this was already good for me. I started using and tinkering
              in computer by the range of my 8 years and to this day I have not
              stopped, every day I fall in love again by technology. <br />I
              also love to play, short of the most varied types, but mainly fps
              is what attracts me the most, who we did not exchange some shots
              in CS? üòâ

              <h2>Programming Journey üíª</h2>
              My journey with programming started in a technical course that
              showed me a little about web, after that I got into university
              with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems and that's when I
              decided what I wanted to be. <br />
              Since I started programming, and to this day, I want to learn
              every day, to realize my dreams and help the community and
              society.
